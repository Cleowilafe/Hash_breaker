# MD5 Hash Cracker

This Python script attempts to crack an MD5 hash using a provided wordlist. It hashes each word in the wordlist and compares the result to the MD5 hash provided by the user. If a match is found, it prints the original word corresponding to the hash.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries are required other than Pythonâ€™s built-in `hashlib` and `argparse` modules.

## Usage

### Command-line Arguments

The script accepts two required arguments:

- `-w` or `--wordlist`: The path to the wordlist file (a plain text file containing possible passwords).
- `-u` or `--hash`: The MD5 hash that needs to be cracked.

### Example Command

To use the script, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python md5_cracker.py -w path/to/wordlist.txt -u <md5_hash>
```

### Example:

If your wordlist is `wordlist.txt` and the MD5 hash you're trying to crack is `5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99` (which corresponds to the word "password"), you would run:

```bash
python md5_cracker.py -w wordlist.txt -u 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
```

### Output

If the script finds a match, it will output something like this:

```
[*] HASH BROKEN: password
```

If the hash is not found in the wordlist, it will print out the MD5 hashes it tries, comparing them with the target hash:

```
e99a18c428cb38d5f260853678922e03 ===== password123
...
```

### Error Handling

If the specified wordlist file is not found, the script will output:

```
Error: The file path/to/wordlist.txt was not found.
```
